{"name":"SPP v2","tagline":"An R package for ChIP-seq data analysis","body":"### **Welcome**\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a site for an improved version of the [spp package](http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/Supplements/ChIP-seq/tutorial.html), initially developed by Dr. Peter Kharchenko, for analyzing ChIP-Seq data. For more details about the biological background and computation methods employed for calling binding positions, please refer to [1].\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Introduction**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe motivation of developing spp v2 is to improve the original spp package such that it can meet current user requests and cope with upcoming challenges. Compared to the original spp package, the new version will be improved in the following aspects:\r\n\r\n* Restructuring the core design based on [reference class](http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/methods/ReferenceClasses)\r\n* Expanding functionalities such as quality control and dealing with replicates\r\n* Improving the visualization, importing and exporting functionalities \r\n* Enhancing the efficiency of parallel computing using [multicore](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multicore/index.html)\r\n* Optimizing memory control to minimize memory usage\r\n* Enabling real-time computing upon visualization of profiles\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Installation**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spp v2 package complies with the bioconductor format, and will be submitted to bioconductor soon. In the future, just use 'biocLite' to install this package. For now, it can only be installed as a source package, so either use 'install.package' inside R or 'R CMD INSTALL' in command line. \r\n\r\nNote that no matter how you want to install spp v2, please pre-install [boost c++](http://www.boost.org/) in order to compile the embedded c++ code. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Developer team and contributors\r\n[Xin Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xin_Wang36), Francesco Ferrari, Nils Gehlenborg, Luca Petiti and [Peter Kharchenko](http://pklab.med.harvard.edu/people.html) (PI)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nPlease contact Xin Wang (xin_wang@hms.harvard.edu) or Peter Kharchenko (peter.kharchenko@post.harvard.edu) if you have any comments, suggestions or find any bug in the package. \r\n\r\n### REFERENCES\r\n[1] Kharchenko PV, Tolstorukov MY, Park PJ.
